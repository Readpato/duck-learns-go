## Introduction

This repository is my own learning journey with Go programming language. It includes various exercises from the course named ["Learning Go with Tests"](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests).

Every chapter is named after the exercise it covers and inside of it there's a README where I document my learning process and share my solutions.
